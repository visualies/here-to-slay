# AGENTS.md

Rules for each session: 

For each change implemented, you MUST run the API tests afterwards with `npm run test:api`.

The dev server must only ever be started by the user - never run `npm run dev` yourself.

If implementing tests, the existing TESTING.md file must be read to understand the testing patterns and conventions.

Do not run  build to verify a working state but use tsc instead and use it after each task completion.
