# AGENTS.md

Rules for each session: 

For each change implemented, you MUST run the API tests afterwards with `npm run test:api`.

The dev server must only ever be started by the user - never run `npm run dev` yourself.

If implementing tests, the existing testing file must be read to understand the testing patterns and conventions.
