# Here to Slay Challenge Cards

In the strategic card game *Here to Slay*, Challenge cards serve as a powerful tool to disrupt your opponents' plans. These cards can be played out of turn to counter another player's move. Here is a list of the different Challenge cards and their effects.

### Standard Challenge Card

The basic Challenge card is a fundamental part of the game, allowing any player to attempt to thwart another's action. There are 14 of these in the base game.

*   **Effect**: "You may play this card when another player attempts to play a Hero, Item, or Magic card. CHALLENGE that card."

When a Challenge card is played, both the challenger and the targeted player roll two dice. If the challenger's roll is equal to or higher than the other player's, the card they were attempting to play is sent to the discard pile, and they lose the action point. If the challenged player's roll is higher, they can proceed with their card play as intended. It's important to note that a card can only be challenged once.

### Class-Specific Challenge Cards

These are more powerful versions of the standard Challenge card, but they often require you to have a Hero of the corresponding class in your party.

*   **Bard Challenge, Berserker Challenge, Druid Challenge, Fighter Challenge, Guardian Challenge, Necromancer Challenge, Ranger Challenge, Sorcerer Challenge, Thief Challenge, Warrior Challenge, and Wizard Challenge**
    *   **Effect**: "You may play this card when another player attempts to play a Hero, Item, or Magic card. CHALLENGE that card. +3 to your roll."

These class-specific cards provide a significant advantage in a challenge by adding a +3 bonus to your dice roll, increasing the probability of a successful challenge. These cards are found in the game's expansions, such as the *Berserkers & Necromancers* and *Warriors & Druids* expansions.
