# Here to Slay Game Rules

## Objective

There are two ways to win Here to Slay:

*   Slay three monsters.
*   Assemble a full party of six different classes.

## Game Setup

1.  Each player chooses a Party Leader card and places it in front of them.
2.  Shuffle the main deck (which includes Hero, Item, Magic, Modifier, and Challenge cards) and deal five cards to each player.
3.  Shuffle the oversized Monster cards and place three face-up in the center of the table.
4.  Each player receives a reference card.

## Your Turn

On your turn, you have three action points to spend on various actions. You can perform the same action multiple times if you have enough points.

**Actions that cost 1 point:**

*   **Draw** a card from the main deck.
*   **Play** a Hero, Item, or Magic card from your hand.
*   **Roll** two dice to use the effect of a Hero card already in your party.

**Actions that cost 2 points:**

*   **Attack** a Monster card.

**Actions that cost 3 points:**

*   **Discard** your entire hand and draw five new cards.

Your turn ends when you have no action points left or choose not to take any more actions. Unused action points do not carry over.

## Card Types

*   **Hero Cards:** These are the adventurers in your party. Each has a class and an effect that you can activate by rolling dice.
*   **Item Cards:** These can be equipped to Heroes to provide bonuses or to enemy Heroes to give them disadvantages (Cursed Items).
*   **Magic Cards:** These are powerful one-time use spells.
*   **Modifier Cards:** These cards can be played at any time to alter a dice roll.
*   **Challenge Cards:** You can use these cards to try and stop another player from playing a Hero, Item, or Magic card. Both players roll dice, and if the challenger's roll is equal to or higher, the card is discarded.

## Attacking Monsters

*   To attack a monster, you must first meet the party requirements listed on the Monster card (e.g., having a certain number of heroes or specific classes).
*   Attacking costs two action points.
*   You roll two dice. If your roll is equal to or higher than the monster's requirement, you slay it.
*   If you roll within the red range indicated on the card, you suffer the consequences listed.
*   When you slay a monster, you gain a new skill for the rest of the game, which is listed on the bottom of the Monster card.

## Important Notes

*   Your Party Leader counts toward class requirements for attacking monsters and for the six-class victory condition, but it does not count as a "Hero" for requirements that specify a number of Heroes.
*   You can only attempt to use a specific Hero's effect once per turn.
