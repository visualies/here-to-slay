# Here to Slay Card Types

## Main Deck Cards

The main deck is comprised of five types of cards: Hero, Item, Magic, Modifier, and Challenge cards.

*   **Hero Cards:** These are adventurers that make up your party. Each Hero card has a class and an effect that can be activated by rolling two dice and meeting the effect's roll requirement. You can have multiple heroes in your party.

*   **Item Cards:** These cards are used to equip your heroes and can provide positive effects or be "Cursed Items" that negatively affect an opponent's hero. An item is placed under a Hero card, and only one item can be equipped to a hero at a time. If a Hero is destroyed or stolen, the equipped Item card goes with it.

*   **Magic Cards:** These are powerful spells with a one-time effect. After a Magic card is used, it is immediately moved to the discard pile.

*   **Modifier Cards:** These cards can be played at any time to alter the outcome of a dice roll, either for yourself or an opponent. Multiple Modifier cards can be used on a single roll.

*   **Challenge Cards:** You can use these cards to try and stop another player from playing a Hero, Item, or Magic card. This initiates a roll-off between the two players. If the challenger wins, the opponent's card is discarded.

## Other Card Types

*   **Party Leader Cards:** Each player starts with a Party Leader card that represents them in the game. These oversized cards have a class and a special skill that provides a unique advantage throughout the game. Unlike Hero card effects, a Party Leader's skill can be used each time its conditions are met.

*   **Monster Cards:** To win the game, you can defeat three Monster cards. To attack a monster, you must meet the requirements listed on the card and then succeed in a dice roll. If you succeed, you "slay" the monster and gain its card, which may provide a permanent bonus. If your roll falls within a certain range, the monster may fight back, causing a negative effect.
