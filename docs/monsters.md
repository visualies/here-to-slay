# Here to Slay Monster Cards

A comprehensive list of "Here to Slay" monster cards and their effects is detailed below, separated by the base game and its expansions.

To defeat a monster, a player must spend two action points, meet the party requirements listed on the card, and then roll two dice. A successful roll is one that is equal to or higher than the number required to slay the monster. However, if the roll falls within a certain lower range, the player will suffer a negative consequence. Once a monster is slain, it is added to the player's party, and its skill becomes a permanent effect for that player.
